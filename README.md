Directory tools
===============
This repository contains a bunch of smaller scripts that I created to handle directories left by a run of photorec, to be able to sort the recovery directory into a directory structure of each filetype collected in their own directories and hashing both directory structures to be able to verify that the sorted files contain the same information as the recovered files.
